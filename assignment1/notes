task 1: predict artists from music


MLP
features: mfcc, spec, extra

- overfit on small data first
- tried attention mechanism
- LR scheduler / Early stopping
- batch parallelization
- wanted best sol w/ validation, not necessarily the model that converged to. opted for a small LR decay for a more shaky solution
- tend to overfit train. tried to get it to match validation with more rigorous regularization strategies
- graph to visualize
CNN
- only spec or mfcc (channels are diff)...
- did not generalize well. probably the music itself alone is not enough to make a classification well


BOTH:
- LR Scheduling (small decay bc we wanted bouncier updates)
- Early stopping on validation acc (looser patience)
- batch parallelization



Future:
- CNN: make features more robust? somehow do mfcc + spec (could be 2 diff CNNs per feature?)
-> could do some kind of ensemble method? needs confidence tho to guess well. could be like binary yes or no for each composer for CNN and then a sigmoid for the MLP and whatever is max get selected?
